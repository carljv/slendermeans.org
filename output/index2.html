              <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I last left chapter 2 of <em>Maching Learning for Hackers</em> (a long time
ago), running some kernel density estimators on height and weight data
(see <a href="../ml4h-ch2-p1.html">here</a>. The next part of the chapter plots a scatterplot of
weight vs. height and runs a lowess smoother through it. I&#8217;m not going
to write any more about the lowess function in statsmodels. I&#8217;ve
discussed some issues with it (i.e. it&#8217;s slow) <a href="../lowess-speed.html">here</a>. And it&#8217;s my
sense that the lowess <span class="caps">API</span>, as it is now in statsmodels, is not long for
this world. The code is all in the IPython notebooks in <a href="https://github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/tree/master/MLFH/CH2">the Github
repo</a> and is pretty straightforward.</p>
<h2>Patsy and statsmodels formulas</h2>
<p>What I want to skip to here is the logistic regressions the authors run
to close out the chapter. Back in the spring, I coded up the chapter in
<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/master/MLFH/CH2/ch2.ipynb">this notebook</a>. At this point, there wasn&#8217;t really much cohesion
between pandas and statsmodels. You&#8217;d end up doing data exploration and
munging with pandas, then pulling what you needed out of dataframes into
numpy arrays, and passing those arrays to statsmodels. (After writing
seemingly needless boilerplate code like
<code>X = sm.add_constant(X, prepend = True ...</code></p>

              <p>I realize I haven&#8217;t blogged about the rest of chapter 2 yet. I&#8217;ll get
back to that, but chapter 3 is on my mind today. If you haven&#8217;t seen
them yet, IPython notebooks up to chapter 9 are all up in the <a href="https://github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/tree/master/MLFH">Github
repo</a>. To view them online, you can check the links on <a href="../category/will-it-python.html">this page</a>.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is about text classification. The authors build a classifier
that will identify whether an e-mail is spam or not (&#8220;ham&#8221;) based on the
content of the e-mail&#8217;s message. I won&#8217;t go into much detail on how the
Naive Bayes classifier they use works (beyond what&#8217;s evident in the
code). The theory is described well in the book and many other places.
I&#8217;m just going to discuss implementation, assuming you know how the
classifier works in theory. The Python code for this project relies
heavily on the <span class="caps">NLTK</span> (Natural Language Toolkit) package, which is a
comprehensive library that includes functions for doing <span class="caps">NLP</span> and text
analysis, as well as an array of benchmark text corpora to use them on.

              <p><em>(Warning: ignorant rant coming up)</em></p>
<p>Like everyone else who&#8217;s ever used it, I love the <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-0.13.1/interactive/htmlnotebook.html">IPython
notebook.</a>Â It&#8217;s not only an awesomely productive environment to work
in, it&#8217;s also the most powerful weapon in the Python evangelist&#8217;s
arsenal (suck it, Matlab).</p>
<p>I also think it&#8217;s not hard to imagine a world where scientific papers
are all just literate programs. And the notebook is probably one of the
best tools for literate programming around in any language. The
intregration of markdown and LaTeX/MathJax into the notebook is just
fantastic.</p>
<p>But it does have one weakness as a literate programming tool. The
default typography is ugly as sin.</p>
<p>There are several issues, but two major ones are easily fixable.</p>
<h2>Long lines</h2>
<p>By far the biggest issue is that the text and input cells extend to 100%
of the window width. Most people keep their browser windows open wider
than is comfortable reading width, so you end up with long hard-to-read
lines of text in the markdown cells.</p>
<p>And for the code, it would be nice to have the code cell discourage you
from long lines. The variable width cells don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m an 80-character

              <p>Despite having finished all the programming for Chapter 2 of <span class="caps">MLFH</span> a
while ago, there&#8217;s been a long hiatus since the<a href="../ml4h-ch2-p1.html">first post on that
chapter</a>.</p>
<h2>(S)lowess</h2>
<p>Why the delay? The second part of the code focuses on two procedures:
lowess scatterplot smoothing, and logistic regression. When implementing
the former in <a href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/generated/statsmodels.nonparametric.api.lowess.html#statsmodels.nonparametric.api.lowess">statsmodels</a>, I found that it was runningÂ <em>dog slow</em>Â on
the data&#8212;in this case a scatterplot of 10,000 height-vs.-weight points.
Indeed, for these 10,000 points, lowess, run with the default
parameters, required about 23 seconds. After importing modules and
defining variables according to my <a href="https://github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/tree/master/MLFH/CH2">IPython notebook</a>, we can run
<code>timeit</code> on the function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">%</span><span class="n">timeit</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="n">lowess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lowess</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">heights</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">weights</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This results in</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="n">loops</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">best</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mf">42.6</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">per</span> <span class="n">loop</span>
</pre></div>


<p>on the machine I&#8217;m writing this on Â (a Windows laptop with a 2.67 GHz i5
processor; timings are faster, but still in the 30 sec. range on my 2.5
GHz i7 Macbook).</p>
<p>An R user&#8212;or really a user of any other statistical package&#8212;is going
to be confused here. We&#8217;re all used to lowess being a relatively
instantaneous procedure. It&#8217;s an oft-used option for ...</p>

              <p>Chapter 2 of <span class="caps">MLFH</span> summarizes techniques for exploring your data:
determining data types, computing quantiles and other summary
statistics, and plotting simple exploratory graphics. I&#8217;m not going to
replicate it in its entirety; I&#8217;m just going to hit some of the more
involved or interesting parts. The IPython notebook I created for this
chapter, which lives <a href="https://github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/tree/master/MLFH/CH2">here</a>, contains more code than I&#8217;ll present on
the blog.</p>
<p>This part&#8217;s highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pandas objects, as we&#8217;ve seen before, have methods that provide
    simple summary statistics.</li>
<li>The plotting methods in Pandas let you pass parameters to the
    Matplotlib functions they call. I&#8217;ll use this feature to mess around
    with histogram bins.</li>
<li>The <code>gaussian_kde</code> (kernel density estimator) function in
    <code>scipy.stats.kde</code> provides density estimates similar to R&#8217;s
    <code>density</code> function for Gaussian kernels. The <code>kdensity</code> function, in
    <code>statsmodels.nonparametric.kde</code> provides that and other kernels, but
    given the state of <code>statsmodels</code>&#8216; documentation, you would probably
    only find this function by accident. It&#8217;s also substantially slower
    than <code>gaussian_kde</code> on large data. *<em>[Not quite so! See
    update at the end.]</em></li>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This post will wrap up Chapter 1 of <span class="caps">MLFH</span>. The only task left is to
replicate the authors&#8217; trellis graph on p. 26. The plot is made up of 50
panels, one for each <span class="caps">U.S.</span> state, with each panel plotting the number of
<span class="caps">UFO</span> sightings by month in that state.</p>
<p>The key takeaways from this part are, unfortunately, a bunch of gripes
about Matplotlib. Since I can&#8217;t transmit, blogospherically, the migraine
I got over the two afternoons I spent wrestling with this graph, let me
just try to succinctly list my grievances.</p>
<ol>
<li>Out-of-the-box, Matplotlib graphs are uglier than those produced by
    either lattice or ggplot in R: The default color cycle is made up of
    dark primary colors. Tick marks and labels are poorly placed in
    anything but the simplest graphs. Non-data graph elements, like
    bounding boxes and gridlines, are too prominent and take focus away
    from the data elements.</li>
<li>The <span class="caps">API</span> is deeply confusing and difficult to remember. You have
    various objects that live in various containers. To make adjustments
    to graphs, you have to remember what container the thing you want to
    adjust lives in, remember what the object and its property is
    called, and ...</li></ol>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../ml4h-ch1-p3.html">last part</a> I made some simple summaries of the cleaned <span class="caps">UFO</span>
data: basic descriptive statistics and historgrams. At the very end, I
did some simple data aggregation by summing up the sightings by date,
and plotted the resulting time series. In this part, I&#8217;ll go further
with the aggregation, totalling sightings by state and month.</p>
<p>This takeaway from this part is that Pandas dataframes have some
powerful methods for aggregating and manipulating data. I&#8217;ll show
<code>groupby</code>, <code>reindex</code>, hierarchical indices, and <code>stack</code> and <code>unstack</code> in
action.</p>
<h2>The shape of data: the long and the wide of it</h2>
<p>The first step in aggregating and reshaping data is to figure out the
final form you want the data to be in. This form is basically defined by
<em>content</em> and <em>shape</em>.</p>
<p>We know what we want the content to be: an entry in the data should give
the number of sightings in a state/month combination.</p>
<p>We have two choices for the shape: wide or long. The wide version of
this data would have months as the rows and states as the columns; it
would be a 248 by 51 table with the number of sigthings as entries. This ...</p>

            <div class="e-content">
              <p>Over the weekend <a href="http://drewconway.com/zia">Drew Conway</a> posted about a data analysis project
he&#8217;d just completed called <a href="http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=2874"><em>Shades of Time</em></a>. Very briefly, he took a
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/s0fld/all_time_magazine_covers_march_1923_to_march_2012/">dataset</a> of Time magazine covers from 1923 to March 2012, then used
some Python libraries to identify the faces in the covers and identify
the skin tone of each face. The result is a really great
interactiveÂ <a href="http://labs.drewconway.com/time/">visualization</a> implemented in <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3.js</a>.</p>
<p>From looking at this data, Drew, with some caveats, observes that &#8220;it
does appear that the variance in skin tones have [sic] changed over
time, and in fact the tones are getting darker.&#8221; He also notes that
there are more faces on covers in later years.</p>
<h2>Why I don&#8217;t believe it</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s no real statistical testing done hereâno formal quantification
how skin-tone representation on covers is changing over time. Instead, I
think he&#8217;s drawing his conclusion on the vizualization alone, especially
the scatterplot in the bottom panel that seems to show more darker tones
appearing later in the date (starting in the 70&#8217;s, the skin-tone
dispersion in his data starts to increase).</p>
<p>He notes that there are difficulties in both identifying faces and skin
tones. After going through his ...</p>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>SeeÂ <a href="../ml4h-ch1-p1.html">Part 1</a> and <a href="../ml4h-ch1-p2.html">Part 2</a>Â for previous work.</p>
<p>In this part, I&#8217;ll replicate the authors&#8217; exploration of the <span class="caps">UFO</span>
sighting dates via histograms. The key takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>The plotting methods in Pandas are easy and useful.</li>
<li>Unlike R <code>Dates</code>, Python <code>datetimes</code> aren&#8217;t compatible with a lot of
    mathematical operations. We&#8217;ll see that you can&#8217;t apply quantile or
    histogram methods to them directly.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Quick data summary methods and datetimeÂ complications.</h2>
<p>For those playing along at home, I&#8217;m at p. 19 of the book. The first
thing the authors do here is get a statistical summary of the sighting
dates in the data, which are recorded in the <code>DateOccurred</code> variable
(which I&#8217;ve named <code>date_occurred</code> in my code). This is easy in R using
the <code>summary</code> function, which provides the minimum, maximum, and
quartiles of the data by default.</p>
<p>Pandas has similar functionality, in a method calledÂ <code>describe</code>, which
gives the same for numeric variables, plus the count of non-null values
and the mean and standard deviation. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">s1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Series</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">randn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">s1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">describe</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>outputs what we&#8217;d expect from a series of randomly-generated standard
normals:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">count</span> <span class="mf">100.000000</span>
<span class="n">mean</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">0.149274 ...</span></pre></div>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../ml4h-ch1-p1.html">previous post</a>, I loaded the raw <span class="caps">UFO</span> data into a Pandas data
frame after cleaning up some irregularities in the text file. Since
we&#8217;re ultimately concerned with analyzing <span class="caps">UFO</span> sightings over time and
space, the next step is to clean those variables and prepare them for
analysis and vizualization.</p>
<p>Some Python techniques to note in this part are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like in the last part, Python string methods are going to come in
    really handy, and be a simple, expressive solution to a lot of
    problems.</li>
<li>When those aren&#8217;t enough, Python has a pretty straightforward set of
    functions for implementing regular expressions.</li>
<li>The <code>map()</code> method in Pandas can be used to &#8220;vectorize&#8221; functions
    along a Series (i.e. a data frame column) and is similar to R&#8217;s
    <code>apply</code>. In general, using a NumPy <code>ufunc</code> (vectorized function) is
    preferable, but not all operations can be expressed in <code>ufunc</code>s.
    This is especially true for non-numeric operations, such as for
    strings or dates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cleaning dates: mapping and subsetting.</h2>
<p>The first two columns of the data are dates in <code>YYMMDDD</code> format, and
Pandas imported them as integers. R has a function, <code>as.Date</code> that will
operate on a vector ...</p>
