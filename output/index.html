              <p>I don&#8217;t tend to get too sniffy about the quality of discourse on the
Internet. I have some appreciation for even the most pointless, uninformed
flamewars. (And maybe my take on Web site comments is for another post.) But
there&#8217;s an increasingly popular topic of articles and blog posts which is starting to annoy
me a little. You&#8217;ve likely read them&#8212;they have titles like: &#8220;Python is Eating R&#8217;s Lunch,&#8221; &#8220;Why
Python is Going to Take Over Data Science,&#8221; &#8220;Why Python is a Pain in the Ass and
Will Never Beat R,&#8221; &#8220;Why Everyone Will Live on the Moon and Code in Julia in 5
Years,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>This style of article obviously isn&#8217;t unique to data analysis
languages. It&#8217;s a classic nerd flamewar, in the proud tradition of text editor wars
and browser wars. Perhaps an added inflammatory agent here is the Data Science hype
machine.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s all okay. Go on the Internet and bitch about languages you don&#8217;t like, or tell
everyone why your preferred one is awesome. That&#8217;s what

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I want to spend some time messing about with iterators in Julia. I think they
not only provide a familiar and useful entry point into Julia&#8217;s type system and dispatch
model, they&#8217;re also interesting in their own right.<a name="fnm-multdisp" href="#fn-multdisp" class="footnote-mark">1</a> Clever application of iterators can
help to simplify complicated loops, better express their intent, and improve
memory usage.</p>
<p>A word of warning about the code here. Much of the it isn&#8217;t idiomatic Julia and I wouldn&#8217;t
necessarily recommend using this style in a serious project. I also can&#8217;t speak
to its performance vis-a-vis more obvious Julian alternatives. In some cases,
the style of the code examples below may help reduce memory usage, but
performance is not my main concern. (This may be the first blogpost about Julia
unconcerned with speed). Instead, I&#8217;m just interested in different ways of
expressing iteration problems.</p>
<p>For anyone who&#8217;d like to play along at home, there&#8217;s an IJulia notebook of
this material on <a href="https://github.com/carljv/Julia-Iterators/blob/master/iterator_tricks.ipynb">Github</a>, which can be viewed on nbviewer <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw2.github.com/carljv/Julia-Iterators/master/iterator_tricks.ipynb?create=1">here</a>.</p>

Let&#8217;s blow the dust off and check it out. One thing before we start: explaining <span class="caps">PCA</span> well is kinda hard. If any experts reading feel like I&#8217;ve described something imprecisely (and have a better description), I&#8217;m very open to suggestions.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Chapter 8 is about <em>Principal Components Analysis</em> (<span class="caps">PCA</span>), which the authors perform on data with time series of prices for 24 stocks. In very broad terms, <span class="caps">PCA</span> is about projecting many real-life, observed variables onto a smaller number of &#8220;abstract&#8221; variables, the principal components. Principal components are selected in order to best preserve the variation and correlation of the original variables. For example, if we have 100 variables in our data, which are all highly correlated, we can project them down to just a few principal components&#8212;-i.e., the high correlation between them can be imagined as coming from an underlying factor that drives all of them, with some other less important factors driving their differences. When variables aren&#8217;t highly correlated, more principal components are needed to describe them well.</p>

              <p>(Note: this is very quick and not well thought out. Mostly a
conversation starter as opposed to any real thesis on the subject.)</p>
<p>This post is a continuation of a Twitter conversation <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmyleswhite/status/332920041626554369">here</a>, started
when John Myles White poked the hornets&#8217; nest. (Python&#8217;s nest? Where do
Pythons live?)</p>

<p>The gist with John&#8217;s code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/johnmyleswhite/5556201">here</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a very thoughtful post. But the conversation was becoming
sort of a shootout and my thoughts (half-formed as they are) were a bit
longer than a tweet. Essentially, I think the Python performance
shootouts&#8212;PyPy, Numba, Cython&#8212;are missing the point.</p>
<p>The point is, I think, that loops are a crutch. A 3-nested for loop in
Julia that increments a counter takes 8 lines of code (1 initialize
counter, 3 for statements, 1 increment statement, 3 end statements).
Only one of those lines tells me what the code does.</p>
<p>But most scientific programmers learned to code in imperative languages
and that style of thinking and coding has become natural. I&#8217;ve often
seen comments like this:</p>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Chapter 7 of <em>Machine Learning for Hackers</em> is about numerical
optimization. The authors organize the chapter around two examples of
optimization. The first is a straightforward least-squares problem like
that we&#8217;ve encountered already doing linear regressions, and is amenable
to standard iterative algorithms (e.g. gradient descent). The second is
a problem with a discrete search space, not clearly differentiable, and
so lends itself to a stochastic/heuristic optimization technique (though
we&#8217;ll see the optimization problem is basically artificial). The first
problem gives us a chance to play around with Scipy&#8217;s optimization
routines. The second problem has us hand-coding a Metropolis algorithm;
this doesn&#8217;t show off much new Python, but it&#8217;s fun nonetheless.</p>
<p>The notebook for this chapter is at the github report <a href="https://github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/tree/master/MLFH/ch7">here</a>, or you
can view it online via nbviewer <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/master/MLFH/ch7/ch7.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Ridge regression by least-squares</h2>
<p>In <a href="../ml4h-ch6.html">chapter 6</a> we estimated <span class="caps">LASSO</span> regressions, which added an L1
penalty on the parameters to the <span class="caps">OLS</span> loss-function. The ridge regression
works the same way, but applies an L2 penalty to the parameters. The
ridge regression is a somewhat more straightforward optimization
problem, since the L2 norm we use gives us a differentiable loss
function.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, Chapter 6 is the most important chapter in <em>Machine
Learning for Hackers</em>. It introduces the fundamental problem of machine
learning: overfitting and the bias-variance tradeoff. And it
demonstrates the two key tools for dealing with it: regularization and
cross-validation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a fun chapter to write in Python, because it lets me play with
the fantastic <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> library. scikit-learn is loaded with
hi-tech machine learning models, along with convenient &#8220;pipeline&#8221;-type
functions that facilitate the process of cross-validating and selecting
hyperparameters for models. Best of all, it&#8217;s <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">very well
documented</a>.</p>
<h2>Fitting a sine wave with polynomial regression</h2>
<p>The chapter starts out with a useful toy example&#8212;trying to fit a curve
to data generated by a sine function over the interval [0, 1] with added
Gaussian noise. The natural way to fit nonlinear data like this is using
a polynomial function, so that the output, <em>y</em> is a function of powers
of the input <em>x</em>. But there are two problems with this.</p>
<p>First, we can generate highly correlated regressors by taking powers of
<em>x</em>, leading to noisy parameter estimates. The input <em>x</em> are evenly
space numbers on the interval [0, 1]. So <em>x</em> and <em>x ...</em></p>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 of <em>Machine Learning for Hackers</em> is a relatively simple
exercise in running linear regressions. Therefore, this post will be
short, and I&#8217;ll only discuss the more interesting regression example,
which nicely shows how patsy formulas handle categorical variables.</p>
<h2>Linear regression with categorical independent variables</h2>
<p>In chapter 5, the authors construct several linear regressions, the last
of which is a multi-variate regression descriping the number of page
views of top-viewed web sites. The regression is pretty straightforward,
but includes two categorical variables: <code>HasAdvertising</code>, which takes
values <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>; and <code>InEnglish</code>, which takes values <code>Yes</code>,
<code>No</code> and <code>NA</code> (missing).</p>
<p>If we include these variables in the formula, then patsy/statmodels will
automatically generate the necessary dummy variables. For
<code>HasAdvertising</code>, we get a dummy variable equal to one when the the
value is <code>True</code>. For <code>InEnglish</code>, which takes three values, we get two
separate dummy variables, one for <code>Yes</code>, one for <code>No</code>, with the missing
value serving as the baseline.</p>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to write much about this chapter. In my opinion the payoff-to-effort ratio for this project is pretty low. The algorithm for ranking e-mails is pretty straightforward, but in my opinion seriously flawed. Most of the code in the chapter (and there&#8217;s a lot of it) revolves around parsing the text in the files. It&#8217;s a good exercise in thinking through feature extraction, but it&#8217;s not got a lot of new <span class="caps">ML</span> concepts. And from my perspective, there&#8217;s not much opportunity to show off any Python goodness. But, I&#8217;ll hit a couple of points that are new and interesting.</p>
<p>The complete code is at the Github repo <a href="https://github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/tree/master/MLFH/ch4">here</a>, and you can read the notebook via nbviewer <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/carljv/Will_it_Python/master/MLFH/ch4/ch4.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Vectorized string methods in pandas.</strong> Back in <a href="../ml4h-ch1-p2.html">Chapter 1</a>, I groused about lacking vectorized functions for operations on strings or dates in pandas. If it wasn&#8217;t a numpy ufunc, you had to use the pandas <code>map()</code> method. That&#8217;s changed a lot over the summer, and since pandas 0.9.0, we can call <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/basics.html#vectorized-string-methods">vectorized string methods</a>.</p>
<p>For example, here&#8217;s the code in my chapter for program that identifies e-mails that ...</p>

              <p>The logistic regression we ran for <a href="../ml4h-ch2-p2.html">chapter 2 of <em>Machine Learning for
Hackers</em></a> was pretty simple. So I wanted to find an example that would
dig a little deeper into statsmodels&#8217;s capabilities and the power of the
patsy formula language.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m taking an intermission from <em>Machine Learning for Hackers</em> and
am going to show an example from Gelman and Hill&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/"><em>Data Analysis Using
Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models</em></a> <em>(&#8220;<span class="caps">ARM</span>&#8221;)</em>. The chapter
has a great example of going through the process of building,
interpreting, and diagnosing a logistic regression model. We&#8217;ll end up
with a model with lots of interactions and variable transforms, which is
a great showcase for patsy and the statmodels formula <span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<h2>Logistic model of well-switching in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Our data are information on about 3,000 respondent households in
Bangladesh with wells having an unsafe amount of arsenic. The data
record the amount of arsenic in the respondent&#8217;s well, the distance to
the nearest safe well (in meters), whether that respondent &#8220;switched&#8221;
wells by using a neighbor&#8217;s safe well instead of their own, as well as
the respondent&#8217;s years of education and a dummy variable indicating
whether they belong to ...</p>
