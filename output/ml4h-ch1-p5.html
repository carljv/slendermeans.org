        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This post will wrap up Chapter 1 of <span class="caps">MLFH</span>. The only task left is to
replicate the authors&#8217; trellis graph on p. 26. The plot is made up of 50
panels, one for each <span class="caps">U.S.</span> state, with each panel plotting the number of
<span class="caps">UFO</span> sightings by month in that state.</p>
<p>The key takeaways from this part are, unfortunately, a bunch of gripes
about Matplotlib. Since I can&#8217;t transmit, blogospherically, the migraine
I got over the two afternoons I spent wrestling with this graph, let me
just try to succinctly list my grievances.</p>
<ol>
<li>Out-of-the-box, Matplotlib graphs are uglier than those produced by
    either lattice or ggplot in R: The default color cycle is made up of
    dark primary colors. Tick marks and labels are poorly placed in
    anything but the simplest graphs. Non-data graph elements, like
    bounding boxes and gridlines, are too prominent and take focus away
    from the data elements.</li>
<li>The <span class="caps">API</span> is deeply confusing and difficult to remember. You have
    various objects that live in various containers. To make adjustments
    to graphs, you have to remember what container the thing you want to
    adjust lives in, remember what the object and its property is
    called, and then remember how Matplotlib&#8217;s <em>getting</em> and <em>setting</em>
    procedures work.</li>
<li>The <code>pyplot</code> set of commands is supposed to provide convenience
    functions, but these abstractions seem to leak early and often. Once
    you need to make finer adjustments, you&#8217;re back to the underlying
    <span class="caps">API</span> nightmare.</li>
<li>The documentation is both clear and comprehensive. But where it is
    clear, it is not comprehensive, and where it is comprehensive, it is
    not clear. For example, the <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/artists.html">Artist tutorial</a> is a pretty clear
    big picture of Matplotlib&#8217;s <span class="caps">API</span>. Once you need any detail, though,
    you&#8217;re dealing with <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/artist_api.html#module-matplotlib.lines">this</a>.</li>
<li>Creating trellis graphs requires way more manual work than in either
    lattice or ggplot. The <code>supblot</code> functionality of Matplotlib is
    highly flexible, but in most cases, the user is going to want the
    code to do the thinking for them and not manually place every graph
    (or do a bunch of bookkeeping with loops).</li>
</ol>
<p>With that off my chest, let me say that I have a ton of respect for
Matplotlib&#8217;s developers. It is a massively complex library, and clearly
very powerful and flexible. I have no doubt that Matplotlib gurus can do
amazing things. I&#8217;m just trying to convey the non-guru&#8217;s perspective.
Graphing libraries are difficult to design because they must be
incredibly flexible and allow users to manipulate all of the myriad
parts of the graph, but at the same time, they can&#8217;t overwhelm users
with detail when the flexibility isn&#8217;t needed. How anyone does
it–especially in an open-source project–I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible that I&#8217;m just <em>Doing it Wrong</em>, and in fact there are
easy ways to do all the things I&#8217;ve complained about. If that&#8217;s the
case, I hope someone reading this will enlighten me.</p>
<h2>Trellis graphs in R and Matplotlib</h2>
<p>In my opinion, trellis graphs are the &#8220;killer app&#8221; of multivariate data
visualization. I produce trellis line and scatter plots more than almost
any other kind of visualization. As such, it&#8217;s important for me to be
able to easily produce quality trellis graphs.</p>
<p>Trellis graphs are easy to create in R. The two most popular high-level
graphing packages in R, lattice and ggplot, both have simple methods for
creating them. Indeed, creating trellis graphs is lattice&#8217;s <em>raison
d&#8217;etre</em>, and the functionality and interface design in the package
revolves around dealing with trellis graph and the panels within. In
ggplot, the trellis is not such a central focus, but it still has
easy-to-use methods for making and modifying trellis graphs (which it
refers to as &#8220;faceted&#8221; graphs).</p>
<p>For example, the graph we want to make is a one liner in lattice:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>xyplot<span class="p">(</span>sightings <span class="o">~</span> year_month <span class="o">|</span> us_state<span class="p">,</span> data <span class="o">=</span> sightings_counts<span class="p">,</span>
type <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;l&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> layout <span class="o">=</span> c<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">10</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once you get the hang of R&#8217;s formula expressions–which doesn&#8217;t take
long–this is an easy, expressive way to create a trellis graph. The
authors use ggplot, which I find a bit less natural, but is still very
easy.</p>
<p>Part of what makes trellis graphs to straightforward in R is that the
concept of factors, and their use as conditioning variables, is so
well-baked into the language. Matplotlib is essentially a plotting
utility for NumPy, so it&#8217;s designed to plot arrays, not rich data
structures. Without factors, without a notion of conditioning, and to a
lesser extent, without formulas, trellis graphs just don&#8217;t come
naturally.</p>
<p>Pandas, though, has structures that, if a plotting library was designed
to understand them, might provide for easy trellis-ing. Even though
Pandas doesn&#8217;t have factors, I could see, for example, a <code>plot</code> method
for Pandas&#8217; <code>groupby</code> objects that produces trellis graphs by default.</p>
<h2>Plotting the <span class="caps">UFO</span> trellis graph</h2>
<p>With all that throat-clearing out of the way, let&#8217;s get down to plotting
the graph. The authors plot 50 state panels, with a 10-by-5 layout.
Since I&#8217;ve included <span class="caps">D.C.</span> in my data, I have to plot 51 panels. You can
fit this in a 17-by-3 layout, but that&#8217;s pretty awkward. I&#8217;d like to
have 4 columns instead, but to fit 51 graphs, I&#8217;ll need 13 columns.
That&#8217;s 52 subplots, meaning the 13th row won&#8217;t have graphs in every
column, only the first three. I&#8217;m going to call these last three graphs
the <code>hangover</code> graphs, and I&#8217;m going to define it as its own variable to
help inform the layout procedures I run later.</p>
<p>Here are the layout parameters, then:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">nrow</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">ncol</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">hangover</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">us_states</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">ncol</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">sourcecode</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now let me get the &#8220;framing&#8221; objects in place: the figure, the subplot
layout, and the titles.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">fig</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">axes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">plt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">subplots</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nrow</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ncol</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sharey</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span>

             <span class="n">size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>


<p>The <code>subplots</code> function is some recently-implement syntactic sugar
around Matplotlib&#8217;s <code>subplot</code> functionality (see the section on &#8220;Easy
Pythonic Subplots&#8221; <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/whats_new.html#easy-pythonic-subplots">here</a>). The <code>sharey</code> argument tells Matplotlib
that the panels should all share the same y axis. Technically I want it
to share an x axis too, but Matplotlib kept throwing errors when I tried
to use the <code>sharex</code> argument with dates on the x-axis. Give the data,
the panels will end up sharing an x axis anyway, so this argument isn&#8217;t
necessary. The function returns two objects: <code>fig</code> refers to the overall
figure container, and <code>axes</code> is an array containing each of the
subplot/panel objects – so <code>axes[0, 0]</code> is the first panel.</p>
<p>Now the rest of the code:</p>

</pre></div>


<p>Let&#8217;s walk through this:</p>
<p>First, set up a counter to keep track of what state we&#8217;re plotting. This
is a little un-Pythonic, but given what I do inside the loop, I couldn&#8217;t
think of a better way.</p>
<p>Now, for each row, column in the 13-by-4 array of panels (and this code
works for any row/column combination, as long as rows &times; columns &gt;=
51):</p>
<ol>
<li>Assign the panel (&#8220;axis&#8221;) associated with this row, column pair to
    its own variable.</li>
<li>Draw gray gridlines in the panel.</li>
<li>Go to the state in the <code>us_state</code> list corresponding to the current
    value of the state counter.</li>
<li>Select this state out of the <code>sightings_counts</code> series and plot its
    data in the current panel. Then, put a text label with the state&#8217;s
    initials in the upper left corner.</li>
<li>If I&#8217;ve gone through all the states, and the state counter variable
    is greater than 51, then make the panel invisible.</li>
<li>Assign the x- and y-axis <code>ticklabel</code> objects for the current panel
    to variables. We&#8217;re going to manipulate their attributes.</li>
<li>
<p>Now some tricky stuff. I want do the following things to the tick
    labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to turn off the x-axis tick labels for all but the
    bottom-most panels, taking into account the hangover.</li>
<li>I want to alternate the y-axis tick labels so that they are on
    the left for odd-numbered rows, and on the right for
    even-numbered rows. Having labels on both sides makes the graph
    easier to read, but having them on the same side on every row
    leads to overcrowding and overlapping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, I want the x-axis tick labels rotated 90 degrees. This
    gives space to put as many as possible on the graph without
    overcrowding (here, we can label every two years).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s the result:</p>
<p><a href="../images/ufo_ts_bystate.png">
    <img src="../images/ufo_ts_bystate.png" width=500px />
</a></p>
<p>Not bad, I think. And maybe even better than the out-of-the-box version
you get with ggplot. But it was a tremendous amount of work, and I don&#8217;t
know if I&#8217;m going to be able to decipher this code six months from now.
It&#8217;s just a tremendous amount of bookkeeping I have to do keeping track
of what panel I&#8217;m in and where it&#8217;s located in the layout. There ought
to be a function that does this for me.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So that&#8217;s it for Chapter 1 of <span class="caps">MLFH</span>. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised
by Pandas and how easy it made loading, cleaning, and manipulating data.
While there are a couple of things from R that I missed, there were
several other things I though were easier and more flexible with Pandas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, going from lattice and ggplot to Matplotlib is like
taking a time machine back to the early &#8216;90s. After reading the
documentation and experimenting for several days, I still don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;m sure how it works. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get the hang of it as I go
forward.</p>
<p>My take is the Python data analysis community is aware of its
&#8220;visualization gap&#8221; vis-a-vis R, and there are tools in the works to
solve this issue. I&#8217;ve heard whispers about &#8220;ggplot for Python&#8221; or &#8220;D3
for Python.&#8221; Everything is still in the early stages, and it will
probably be a while before better tools are available.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also a little uncertain about the &#8220;x for Python&#8221; notion of creating
graphing libraries. Matplotlib&#8217;s <code>pyplot</code> is essentially a &#8220;Matlab for
Python&#8221; approach to graphics, and I don&#8217;t know that works to its credit.
I&#8217;d much rather have a solid, Pythonic graphing library that lets me
easily make publication-quality versions of the workhorse data graphics,
than have something that apes the latest faddish graphing tool. There
are a lot of smart people working on the problem, though, and I&#8217;m really
excited to see what happens.</p>
