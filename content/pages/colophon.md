Title: Colophon
Author: Carl Vogel

## Code

This site was made with [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com), a Python-based static site generator. Pelican renders posts and pages written in Restructured Text or Markdown into HTML. The site's theme was designed using the [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org) templating language.

Code and content for the site were composed in [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

## Typography

The body text for the site is [Iowan Old Style](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/iowan-old-style/), designed by [John Downer](http://coopertype.org/faculty/john-downer).

Page titles and headings are in [Verb Extra Condensed](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/verb-extra-condensed), designed by Ryan Martinson for [Yellow Design Studio](http://yellowdesignstudio.com/).

Monospaced text (for example, in code listings) is in Adobe's [Source Code Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html).

Navigation links in the header are in Adobe's [Source Sans Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html). Adobe offers both Source Sans and Source Code for free.

Icons are in the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) icon font.

Code syntax highlighting is made possible by the epic [Pygments](http://www.pygments.org) project.

Certain other typographic features on the page are facilitated by Christian Metts's [`typogrify`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/typogrify) package.
