Title: About
Author: Carl

At the moment, I'm participating in the Winter 2014 batch of [Hacker School](www.hackerschool.com).

Before that I was an economic consultant for over seven years. My work focused on statistical, econometric, and other technical analyses of issues that arise in securities fraud and similar cases.

You can download my r&#233;sum&#233; <a href="../../files/Resume.pdf" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Files', 'Download', 'Resume']);">here</a>, if you're so inclined.


My interests are in programming, statistics, econometrics and machine learning, as well as in typography and graphic design.

I live in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn with my lovely wife and our little dog, too.
